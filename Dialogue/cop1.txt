Good evening, Detective. Emily was a 32-year-old doctor at Sacred Heart hospital. She was found dead in her apartment this morning, and it appears she died by suicide. 

We found a note on the kitchen counter. It seems like she was going through a tough time and struggling with some personal issues.

We have spoken with her colleagues and some of her neighbors, but we have not been able to locate any family members yet.

We also found some prescription medications in her bathroom, and her colleagues at the hospital mentioned that she had been feeling stressed and overwhelmed lately.

She was found dead in her bedroom and from the initial forensice analysis, it may have been poison. When we entered her premise we had to brute force the door, it was locked from inside.
